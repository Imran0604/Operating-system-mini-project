Disk Scheduling Simulator
This Bash script simulates various Disk Scheduling Algorithms, including:

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)


Features
✅ Reads inputs from external files for disk size, initial head position, and request queue.
✅ Allows user selection of disk scheduling algorithm.
✅ Supports visualization of head movement for better understanding.
✅ Implements efficient sorting and seek time calculations.

How It Works
The script reads input values from:
disk_size.txt (Total number of cylinders)
head_position.txt (Initial head position)
Request_queue.txt (Space-separated track requests)
The user selects a disk scheduling algorithm from the menu.
The selected algorithm is executed, and the total seek time and head movement path are displayed.
A visual representation of head movement is generated in the terminal.
